His groundbreaking discoveries on the ubiquitin system and its major roles in homeostasis and in pathogenetic mechanisms of many diseases have paved the way to new platforms for drug development. He received his M.D. (1973) from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and continued his studies to obtain a doctorate in biological sciences in the Faculty of Medicine in the Technion (D.Sc.; 1982). There, as a graduate student with Dr. Avram Hershko and in collaboration with Dr. Irwin A. Rose from the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, USA, they discovered that covalent attachment of ubiquitin to a targetprotein signals it for degradation. They deciphered the mechanism of conjugation, described the general proteolytic functions of the system, and proposed a model according to which this modification serves as a recognition signal for a specific downstream protease. As a post- doctoral fellow with Dr. Harvey Lodish at the M.I.T., he continued his studies on the ubiquitin system and made additional important discoveries. Along the years it has become clear that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis plays major roles in numerous cellular processes, and aberrations in the system underlie the pathogenetic mechanisms of many diseases, among them certain malignancies and neurodegenerative disorders. Among the numerous prizes Ciechanover received are the 2000 Albert Lasker Award, the 2003 Israel Prize, and the 2004 Nobel Prize (Chemistry; shared with Drs. Hershko and Rose). Among many academies, Prof Ciechanover is a member of the Israeli National Academy of Sciences and Humanities, The European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Foreign Fellow), the American Philosophical Society, the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) and Medicine (NAM) of the USA (Foreign Associate), the Pontifical Academy of Sciences at the Vatican, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS; Foreign Member), the Russian Academy of Sciences (Foreign Member), and the German Academy of Sciences (Leopoldina).',

With this overall vision of providing convenient service and improving the patients’ quality of life, the DiabetesCenter provides all the necessary tests and physicians in a wide range of specialties under one roof, thus enabling comprehensive treatment of diabetes. The Bildirici Diabetes Center is the first and only such center in Israel. It operates according to an innovative approach that aims to streamline and shorten the medical process for diabetes patients, thus assisting them to cope with the disease and its side-effects, and to adjust to a new lifestyle. A medical specialist manages each patient’s medical file. This specialist operates in full cooperation with all the other specialists, consulting with them regularly regarding each step and decision regarding the patient. Managing the medical file under one roof saves the patient the aggravation of having to cope with multiple, disparate opinions.

Patient stay in the clinic is several hours. For the patients’ comfort and enjoyment during their stay, the center provides comfortable sitting areas where they may read, write, eat, and drink in an atmosphere that is homey, warm, and considerate.',

  'Dr. Orit Kollet received her BSc from Bar Ilan University (1992), MSc from Tel Aviv University (1995), and a PhD degree from the Weizmann Institute of Science (2000) in the department of Immunology under the mentorship of Prof. Tsvee Lapidot. Her research focused first on the development of pre-clinical and functional models for research of mechanisms regulating homing and mobilization of blood-forming stem cells. As a staff scientist with prof. Lapidot, Dr. Kollet extended her research interests to include mechanisms of stress-induced mobilization of stem cells from the bone marrow to the blood and injured liver. Studies of microenvironmental regulators of stem cell function in steady-state and injury included elucidating the roles of bone degrading osteoclasts, bone marrow blood vessels, and the light/dark daily cycles, which all control stem cell activity in the bone marrow and blood circulation. Dr. Kollet has published more than 70 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Currently, Dr. Kollet is serving as an academic scientific consultant to Prof. Tvee Lapidot in the field of hematopoietic stem cells biology, and Prof. Irit Sagi in the field of extracellular matrix remodeling in health and disease, both from the department of Immunology and Regenerative Biology, of Weizmann Institute of Science.',
